A simple responsive admin dashboard built using HTML, CSS Grid, and vanilla JavaScript, including light/dark theme switching using CSS variables.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for page structure
- CSS3 with CSS Grid for layout
- CSS variables for theming
- JavaScript for dynamic theme toggle and local Storage

## Learning Outcomes of Experiment

By completing this experiment, the student is able to:

1. Design a **responsive** admin dashboard layout using CSS Grid (defining grid tracks, areas, and breakpoints).  
2. Implement a fixed sidebar, top navigation bar, and content area using a grid-based page structure.  
3. Use CSS custom properties (variables) to define color tokens for backgrounds, text, borders, and accents.  
4. Implement light and dark themes by switching a `data-theme` attribute and updating CSS variables.  
5. Write JavaScript to toggle themes at runtime and persist the selected theme using `local Storage`.  
6. Organize a small front-end project and document it in a GitHub repository with a clear README.
